#EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT:

In today's fast-paced business environment, managing employees and their payroll can be a challenging task for any organization. To overcome this challenge, many companies are turning to automated employee management and payroll systems to streamline their operations and improve efficiency. A web-based employee management and payroll system is a powerful tool that enables businesses to manage their workforce effectively. This system not only helps to automate time-consuming administrative tasks, but it also provides valuable insights into employee performance, attendance, and productivity.

This project aims to develop a robust and user-friendly web-based employee management and payroll system that can help organizations simplify their human resource management processes. The system will include features such as employee profile management, attendance tracking, leave management, payroll processing, and reporting
